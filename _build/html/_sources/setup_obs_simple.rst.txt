The idea of the simple implementation is to combine multiple polygons to form a structure. The polygons can overlap each other. The priority is given to the polygons specified in later definitions. For example, if you make a subtraction earlier, then specify an addition which covers the subtracted area, the final structure will take the overlapped addition rather than subtraction.
